# üêç Snake Game

A classic snake game developed in JavaScript, with the main objective of practicing the language syntax, reviewing functions, learning about Canvas manipulation and understanding fundamental web programming concepts.

## üéØ Project Goal

This project was created as a practical exercise to learn and solidify knowledge in:

* **Basic JavaScript Syntax**: Variables, data types (arrays, objects), operators, etc.
* **Control Flow Structures**: Use of `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for` loops.
* **Functions**: Definition and calling of functions.
* **HTML Canvas API Manipulation**: Drawing shapes, color control, and animations.
* **Array and Object Manipulation**: Managing snake and food positions.
* **Browser Events**: Capturing user input (keyboard) for movement.
* **Game Logic**: Implementing basic arcade game rules.
* **Random Position Generation**: For the food.
* **Collision Handling**: With the snake itself and game boundaries.

## ‚ú® Features

* Basic visual game interface.
* Character (snake) and its movements controlled by the keyboard.
* Generation of "apples" in random positions on the board.
* Detection when the apple is "eaten" by the player.
* Audio addition when the player eats the apple.
* Collision detection (with game boundaries and the snake's own body).
* "Game Over" screen with score.
* "Play Again" functionality.

## üöÄ How to Run the Game

To play, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` files, and the audio folder directly).
2.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.). You can simply drag the file into the browser window or use an extension like VS Code's "Live Server" for a development experience.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to start playing!

## üí° Lessons Learned and Challenges Overcome

During the development of this project, I explored and solidified knowledge in:

* **Canvas Drawing**: Understanding how to use `fillRect`, `fillStyle`, and `clearRect` to create and animate visual elements.
* **Game State Management**: How to keep track of the snake (array of segments), the food, and the game state (playing, game over).
* **Snake Movement Logic**: Adding and removing segments from the snake array to simulate movement and growth.
* **Collision Detection**: Implementing logic to check if the snake's head collided with walls or its own body.
* **Keyboard Event Handling**: Capturing `keydown` to control the snake's direction.
* **Code Organization**: Structuring functions for different parts of the game logic (drawing, updating, collision, etc.).
* **Audio Integration**: Adding simple sound effects.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contribution

This is a learning project, but feel free to inspect the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a base for your own studies.
I had access to this class through the YouTube channel 'Manual do Dev'
The game's visuals were inspired by Google's snake game
